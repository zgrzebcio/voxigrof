/* ---- generation throttle (0.7143) ----
   Generation is the single most expensive thing this game does, and pump() used to feed it as
   hard as the worker pool would take: every worker filled to two jobs, continuously, for as long
   as the queue had anything in it. Flying across terrain therefore pinned every core for minutes
   at a time — the fan noise and the battery drain you noticed.

   Two dials shape it:

     max — how many generation jobs may be in flight at once
     gap — minimum milliseconds between handing out two of them

   They are driven by the DISTANCE of the next chunk waiting, not by how many are waiting.

   Keying them to queue LENGTH was the obvious reading of "slower when there is more to do", and
   it does not work: at render distance 16 the queue legitimately holds 800 chunks, so the deepest
   throttle latched permanently and generation never caught up. Measured coverage was 6-24% of the
   render radius — a steady 165fps spent drawing an empty world, which is not a performance win,
   it is a broken render distance.

   Distance is the honest signal. A hole four chunks away is one you are looking at, so it is
   worth full speed; the far horizon can arrive at a leisurely pace nobody will notice. The result
   still removes the thing that actually heats the machine — every core pinned on generation for
   minutes at a stretch — because past the near ring the gap caps throughput to a steady rate
   instead of letting it saturate. It just converges while doing so.

   Meshing is never throttled: it is the cheap half, and it is what you actually see appear.
