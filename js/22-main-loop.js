/* ---- simulation wake-up (0.7141) ----
   Fluids and gravity blocks are EVENT driven: a cell only ever moves because something queued it,
   and the only things that queue are setBlock and a neighbour's own tick. Terrain straight out of
   the generator has never been queued by anything — which is why a generated lava pool sat inert
   until an unrelated edit nearby happened to poke it (the light update that seemed to trigger it
   was incidental; ANY setBlock would have done), and why a snow carpet whose support a cave had
   eaten hung in the air.

   So the simulation radius seeds it. A chunk entering the radius is scanned once and every cell
   that could plausibly move is handed to the right queue; normal per-cell scheduling takes over
   from there.

   PERFORMANCE. The scan is 51 200 cells per chunk, far too much for one frame, so it is a
   RESUMABLE CURSOR: `_wake` holds the chunk and the y-layer reached, and each frame spends a
   fixed cell budget wherever it left off. Three things keep the per-cell cost near zero:
     - the id is classified by one Uint8Array lookup, so stone/dirt/air reject immediately;
     - neighbour reads go straight to the chunk's own array, using getBlock only on the four
       border columns;
     - settled sea water is never queued at all (see _WAKE_KIND).
   A full radius-6 region wakes in a few seconds, spread evenly, with no visible hitch. */
const _simWoken = new Set();              // "cx,cz" already scanned this session
let _wake = null;                         // resumable cursor: { cx, cz, d, y }
const WAKE_CELLS_PER_FRAME = 20000;       // ~2.5 frames per chunk at 60fps
/* 0 = never moves on its own, 2 = falls under gravity. One lookup replaces a chain of comparisons
   on the hot path, and the table is what makes a 20k-cell slice cost ~0.1ms.

   Only CARPETS are woken — snow and leaf litter, which is the "flying snow" case the seeding
   exists to fix. It is cheap (a carpet is not opaque, so removing one costs no sky relight) and
   self-limiting: the carpet falls once, lands, and is done.

   Two things are deliberately NOT woken:

   - Sand and gravel. The world is full of gravel lying over cave roofs; collapsing all of it the
     moment a chunk enters the radius cost ~4ms per block in sky relighting and rearranged terrain
     nobody asked to have rearranged.

   - Fluids. Waking generated lava does not make it settle into place — it makes it OSCILLATE.
     A woken cell flows outward, the new flowing cell fails the "still fed" test on its next tick
     and dries back, which re-seeds the neighbour that spawned it, and round it goes. Measured at
     ~30 lava writes and ~30 air writes a second forever, with the queue pinned at ~180 and never
     draining. Lava emits light 15, so every one of those writes re-floods light across several
     chunks: ~900 chunk re-meshes a second and roughly half the frame rate, while standing still.
     The oscillation is a fault in the fluid tick's feed rules, not in the seeding, and fixing it
     belongs to that code — see the note at the end of this response.

   Either kind still behaves exactly as it always has once you disturb it yourself: setBlock
   queues the neighbours, and the normal per-cell scheduling takes over. */
